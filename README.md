# Super Textiles Android App

## Description:
Textile Android App helps the textile business in maintaining their business records. Using this Android app, you can Create Challan (Transportation Document), update it and delete it anytime. You can also create a PDF document of any Challan.

You can create Bill, update the bill and delete the bill whenever required. You can also create a PDF document of Bill, in which all the challan attached to that bill will be added first in the PDF document after that bill will be added to the last page of the document.

This app creates a ‘Business Report’ whenever you create Bill. In the Report section of this app, you will find all the transactions done by you. You can also edit some details from the Report section and some details from the Bills section of ‘Business Report’. You can also create a PDF document containing all the transactions done by you.

This app also contains the Customers section that will maintain all details related to your customers. Maintaining this record will help you in creating Challans and Bills, as these sections require Customer details, so you do not have to enter it every time you create Challan and Bill. You can create new Customer, edit them and can also delete anytime.

This app will help you creating Challans, Bills, and Business Reports easily and quickly as it saves all repetitive information, in that sense, you also need to enter all types of quality once and you can use this quality type while creating Challans and Bills. You can create new quality and delete then any time from the ‘More’ section of this app.  

Easy to use UI (User Interface) enables the user to create challans and bills in very little time when compared to manual creation. This app stores all your data in Firebase's real-time database, so you do not have to worry about data security and reliability. Even if you lost your phone or uninstalled the app your data will be saved and secured in your Firebase Cloud server.

The ‘About Us’ section of this app shows the basic details of your business such as name, address, bank details, etc. You can also create a PDF document of your Business Card from this section.
This app does not allow the creation of a new user account for security purposes, if you want to add new users, delete users, or any kind of user maintenance, you need to create and maintain it from Firebase Console. In the ‘Authentication’ section of your Firebase Console, you can create new Users, change their password, or delete them.

This app allows the signed-in user to change their password, so when the required user can change their password accordingly.

**Note:** Left swipe the Challan, Bill, Business Report, and Customer to delete and Right swipe the Bill, Business Report to edit.
